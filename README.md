## NeqSim - an open source process simulation software
[NeqSim](https://equinor.github.io/neqsimhome/) is a library for calculation of fluid behavior, phase equilibrium and process simulation. NeqSim can be used as a stand-alone tool via Excel or a web interface. It is integrated in computer programs via available interfaces in Java, Python, .NET, Matlab or in process simulators via the Cape Open interface. The basis for NeqSim is fundamental mathematical models related to unit operations, phase behaviour and physical properties of fluids. NeqSim is used for fluids such as oil and gas, carbon dioxide, refrigerants, hydrogen, ammonia, water and chemicals. 

Support and further development of tools and models using NeqSim can be requested from [Department of Energy and Process Engineering at NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/even.solbraa).

## NeqSim project in GitHub

## NeqSim API
NeqSim is well suited for beeing the basis for developing API's for thermodynamic and process calculations.

* [Example of use of API from Python](https://github.com/EvenSol/NeqSim-Colab/blob/master/API/java/example/TEGprocess.ipynb)

## NeqSimLive 
NeqSimLive is a collection of container based APIs used for simulation and performance monitoring of process plants. NeqSimLive APIs are typically consumed by company specific tools for scheduling calculations, visualization and writing of data.  Support on developing digital twin components for flow assurance, process and transport can be reqested from the [Energy and Process Technology group](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/even.solbraa) at NTNU.

## NeqSim web application
A  web application has been developed to run calculation using neqsim via a web interface. Calculations such as TPflash, dew points, phase envelopes and hydrate equilibrium calculations can be run in the web application. An alternative web application is via Google Colab (Python).
